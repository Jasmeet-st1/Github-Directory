# Github Repository

A simple web application for fetching and displaying GitHub user information.

## Project Description

This project is a web application that allows users to enter a GitHub username. Upon submitting the username, the application redirects to a userInfo page, where it fetches and displays information about the GitHub user using the GitHub REST API.

## How To use

1. Clone the Repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jasmeet-st1/Github-Repository.git
   cd Github-Repository
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser:

3. Enter GitHub Username:
    - On the index.html page, you will see an input field asking for a GitHub username.
    - Enter the desired GitHub username and hit `Search`.

4. View User Information:
    - The application will redirect to the userInfo.html page.
    - The userInfo.html page fetches and displays information about the entered GitHub user using the GitHub REST API. It includes user's basic information like name, bio, avatar and its directories with directory name, description, and topics. 

         The directories are shown in pages with different option in paging (10/page to 100/page).
